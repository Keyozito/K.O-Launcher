**K.O Launcher** is a python program made by me to help *[Keio da Cocker](https://github.com/Keyozito/Keio-da-Cocker)* players to update their modpacks. Before K.O Launcher all updates were done manually, so i decide to make a *Terminal Based* updater/installer!
Here you can automatically download both the _Full Version_ or update you already existing game, the path will be asked at some point so no worries about your minecraft breaking!

> ⚠️ This program is still in development! Some older versions may be incompatible with the launcher, and newer functions will be added to it.

# 📦 Launcher Info
* Developed in Python 3.8
* Current Status: 🛠️ In alpha
